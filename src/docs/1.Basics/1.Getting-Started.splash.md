# Getting Started

Umbra is a plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that provides customizable toolbars and world markers for use in the game. The
toolbar consists of customizable widgets that can be used to display all kinds of information or provide quick access
to various features of the game. World markers are drawn on the game world to help you find various points of interest,
such as gathering nodes, treasure chests, or quest objectives.

Umbra is designed to be _modular_ and fully _customizable_. You can create your own toolbar profiles consisting of any
arrangement of widgets and customize them to your liking. You can also create your own color profiles for the interface
to match the look and feel of your existing UI.

## Installing Umbra

Umbra is a plugin that requires the use of a third-party tool called [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) to run.
Once you have XIVLauncher installed, you can open the plugin installer in-game and search for "Umbra XIV" to install it.

Once you have Umbra installed, a "First Time Setup" window will appear. This window will guide you through the process
of setting up your initial toolbar profile. After you have completed the initial setup, you can access Umbra's settings
window by typing `/umbra` in the chat window.

markers.

# Custom Plugins

Umbra is extensible in a way that allows you to create your own plugins to add new widgets and world markers to the
plugin. This allows you to create custom features that are not available in the base plugin itself.

Visit the [#custom-plugins](https://discord.com/channels/1263935915517149298/1263946232934568082) channel in Umbra's
Discord server for list of community-made plugins.

Plugins posted on the Discord server must abide by the same rules as officially approved Dalamud plugins, meaning they
must not violate the game's terms of service or provide unfair advantages to players.

## Installing a Plugin

> [!CAUTION]
> Plugins are third-party software and can potentially harm your computer or your game. Only download plugins from
> trusted sources and be cautious when installing them.

To install a custom plugin, you need to download the plugin's DLL file and place it somewhere on your computer. The
location doesn't matter as long as you know where it is. Once you have the DLL file, open Umbra's Settings window and
navigate to the "Plugins" tab.

Click on the `Add Plugin` button to open a file dialog. Navigate to the location where you saved the plugin DLL file and
select it. Once you have selected the file, click the `Open` button to add the plugin to Umbra.

A new entry will appear in the list of plugins above the `Add Plugin` button. If anything is wrong with the file you've
selected, a message will appear in the plugin's entry to inform you of the issue.

Restart Umbra to load the plugin by clicking the `Restart Umbra` button that appears after adding a plugin.

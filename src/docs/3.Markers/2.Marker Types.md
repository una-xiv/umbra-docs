# Marker Types

Umbra is shipped with several different types of markers that can be used to mark points of interest on the game world.
Each marker type has its own unique appearance and behavior. This page will explain the different marker types and how
they can be used.

Each marker type has its own settings that can be configured in the "World Markers" tab of Umbra's Settings window. All
markers have the same basic settings as shown in the image below:

![](images/docs/marker-settings.png)

Show markers of this type in the game world:
> This setting can be used to enable or disable all markers of this type. If this setting is disabled, no markers of this
type will be rendered on the game world.

Show direction indicator when out of view:
> This setting can be used to enable or disable the direction indicator for markers of this type. If this setting is
> enabled, a direction indicator will be shown on the screen when the marker is out of view. 

Fade distance & attenuation:
> The fade distance is the maximum distance at which the marker will be rendered. If the player is closer to the marker
> than the fade distance, the marker will be fully invisible. If the player is further away than the fade distance, the
> marker will be fully visible. The attenuation determines how quickly the marker fades out as the player approaches the
> fade distance. A higher attenuation value will increase the fade-out distance, while a lower value will decrease it.
>
> For example, if the fade distance is set to 100 yalms and the attenuation is set to 50, the marker will start to fade
> out as soon as the player is within 150 yalms of the marker, and will be fully invisible when the player is within 100
> yalms of the marker.

Some markers may have additional settings that are specific to that marker type. These settings will be explained in the
respective sections below. You can find a list of all available marker types and their respective settings in the
"World Markers" tab of Umbra's Settings window.

## Aether Currents

Aether Currents are drawn as a blue, swirling vortex. They are used to mark the locations of Aether Currents in the game
world. Aether Currents are used to unlock flying in each zone. Be aware that these markers are only visible when the
player is near an Aether Current, since the game does not provide the exact location of Aether Currents for the entire
map.

## Eureka Bunny Coffers

Whenever you find yourself in Eureka and have an excessive amount of time to kill, it might be worth your while to farm
some Bunny FATEs. When you successfully complete a Bunny FATE, you will be rewarded with a "Lucky Carrot". Once you use
this item, world markers for _possible coffer locations_ will start to appear in the game world. The world markers are
rendered based on the text that appears in the chat log when you use the Lucky Carrot.

While you are moving closer towards the coffer location and use the Lucky Carrot again, the world markers will update to
show the new possible coffer locations. This process can be repeated until you find the coffer.

## FATE Markers

FATE markers are used to mark the locations of FATEs in the game world. They use the icon of the FATE to represent the
type of the encounter. The label also contains the current state and progress of the FATE in case it has already
started.

## Flag Marker

The Flag marker is a simple marker that shows up while there is a flag set on the current map. The marker is rendered
with a flag icon and only displays the distance between the player and the flag.

## Gathering Nodes

Gathering node markers are rendered when the player is in a Gathering job and is in somewhat near a gathering node. You
can also use one of the "scanning" abilities like "Lay of the Land" to reveal the location of a node that is far away.

These markers use an icon to indicate the type of gathering node and display the name of the items that can be gathered
from the node.

## Hunt Markers

Hunt markers are world markers used to locate Notorious Monsters (NMs) in the game world. They are rendered with a
distinct icon that represents the rank of the NM. The label contains the name of the NM and the rank.

Note that only S-Rank monsters are always rendered regardless of the player's proximity. A-Rank and B-Rank monsters are
only rendered when the player is in close proximity to the monster.

## Party Members

These markers are applied to party members that are in the same zone as the player. They are rendered with a unique icon
that represents the current job of the party member. The label contains the name of the party member and their current
distance from the player.

Note that the position of these markers are not updated in real-time if the party members are too far away from you, but
instead update every couple of seconds. This is simply how the game relays the position of party members to you.

## Quest Objectives

These markers are used to mark the locations of quest objectives in the current map. They are rendered with a unique
icon that represents the type of quest objective. The label contains the name of the quest. Some quest objectives may
not always have an icon, in which case the objective usually points towards an area on the map.

## Treasure Coffers

Have you ever found yourself accidentally running past treasure coffers in dungeons? Well, worry no more! Umbra can help
you locate these hidden treasures by rendering world markers for them. The markers are rendered with a chest icon and
show the distance between the player and the coffer.

## Triple Triad Cards

Unlocking all Triple Triad cards can be a daunting task, especially if you are not sure where to find them. These world
markers can help you locate Triple Triad cards in the game world. The markers are rendered with a card icon and show the
name and rank of the card you have yet to collect.

## Sightseeing Log Vistas

Is it time to complete your Sightseeing Log? These markers can help you locate the vistas you have yet to visit. The
markers are rendered with a camera icon and show the name of the vista, as well as which emote you have to perform to
collect it. For time-based vistas, the appropriate time of day is also displayed.

> [!WARNING]
> Sightseeing logs in A Realm Reborn zones have unique conditions that must be met to unlock the vista. Some of these
> require you to collect the first 20 vistas, then speak to an NPC before you can collect the next set of vistas. Umbra
> cannot make a distinction between these conditions, so it will show world markers for all vistas in the log regardless
> of whether you have met the conditions to unlock them.

## Waymark Markers

Waymark markers simply render world markers at the location of Waymarks in case you are too far away to see them
properly. This saves you the trouble of locating the Waymarks on the map and helps you navigate through the content
easier.

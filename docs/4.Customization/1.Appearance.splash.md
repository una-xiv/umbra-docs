| Learn how to customize Umbra to make it unique to fit your playstyle and needs.

# Appearance

Umbra is designed to be highly customizable to fit your playstyle and needs. An important aspect of this is the ability
to customize the appearance of the UI elements, such as the fonts and colors used in the toolbar. The majority of the
appearance settings can be found in the "Appearance" tab of Umbra's Settings window.

## Changing the fonts

Umbra allows you to use any font that is _installed on your system_ for the toolbar and world markers. Navigate to the
"Appearance" tab of Umbra's Settings window and select the font you want to use from the dropdown menu. The font will be
applied immediately after you select it.

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Default font      | The default font used on the toolbar, popups and windows. |
| Monospace font    | The font used for monospaced text, such as the clock.     |
| Emphasis font     | A special type of font used for decorative purposes.      |
| World marker font | The font used for world markers.                          |


## Color Profiles

Umbra comes with a set of predefined color profiles that you can choose from. These color profiles change the colors of
the toolbar, widgets, popups and anything in and around Umbra's windows. You can also create your own color profile by
entering a name in the "New Profile Name" field and clicking the "Create a new Profile" button. The new profile will be
created based on the currently selected profile.

Once a custom profile is activated, a large list of color pickers will appear below. Here you can customize the colors
of any element in Umbra's UI. The changes will be applied immediately after you select a new color.

# The Settings Window

The settings window is where you can customize your toolbar and world markers to your liking. You can access the
settings window by typing `/umbra` in the chat window.

> [!TIP]
> Umbra is a _large_ plugin with _many_ settings. This can feel overwhelming at first, but don't worry! Take your time
> to explore the available settings and experiment with different configurations. You can always reset your settings to
> the default values if you get lost.

The settings window is divided into several "modules", represented as tabs on the left side of the window. Each module
contains a set of settings that you can adjust.

## 1. Toolbar Widgets

This is the first tab you will see when you open the settings window. Here you can add, remove, and reorder the widgets
on your main toolbar, as well as customize the settings for each widget.

## 2. Auxiliary Bar

The Auxiliary Bar is a secondary toolbar that can be placed anywhere on the screen. You can add, remove, and reorder
widgets on the Auxiliary Bar in the same way as the main toolbar.

settings. You can enable or disable them, change their fade distances and more.

between different setups quickly. [Read more about Config Profiles](#/basics/config-profiles).

contains the necessary settings to manage these plugins. [Read more about Plugins](#/customization/plugins).

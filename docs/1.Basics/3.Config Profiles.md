# Config Profiles

Configuration profiles in Umbra contain every single setting that Umbra has to offer. This includes toolbar widgets, 
world markers, general settings, appearance settings, and more. Config profiles allow you to save and load different
configurations of Umbra. This can be useful if you want to switch between different setups quickly or want to experiment
with different configurations without losing your current setup.

To manage these profiles, open the settings window by typing `/umbra` in the chat window. Navigate to the "Config
Profiles" tab. Here you will see a set of four blocks, each providing a different action.

## Changing the active profile

The first block shows the currently active profile. To change the active profile, click on the dropdown menu and select
the profile you want to use. The changes will be applied after you select a new profile and click the "Set as active"
button. Note that some changes in the selected profile may require a restart of Umbra, causing the Settings Window to
close upon changing the profile.

The active config profile is tied to your character. This means that each character can have its own active config
profile. When multiple characters use the same profile, any changes made to the profile will be reflected on all
characters that use it.

> [!CAUTION]
> A config profile contains **ALL** settings in Umbra. This includes your general settings, color profiles collection,
> toolbar widgets, world markers, and more. Therefore, it is _NOT RECOMMENDED_ to share profiles with other people
> because it also overwrites their collections of color and toolbar profiles. Use this feature as a way to manage and
> back-up your own settings.

## Creating a New Profile

To create a new profile, enter a name in the input field and click the "Create and Apply" button. The new profile will
be created based on the currently active profile.

## Copying a Profile

If you want to copy all data from an existing profile to the currently active profile, select the profile you want to
copy from the dropdown menu and click the "Copy and Apply" button. This option may be useful if you've created backups
of your main profile that you wish to restore.

## Deleting a Profile

To delete a profile, select the profile you want to delete from the dropdown menu and click the "Delete" button. This
action will permanently remove the profile from your configuration. Be aware that this action cannot be undone.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting the active profile will revert the currently active profile back to the "Default" profile. Note that the
> "Default" profile cannot be deleted. This operation is irreversible and cannot be undone.

## Positioning the toolbar

The main toolbar can be positioned on either the top or bottom of the screen. You can choose either by selecting the
checkbox that says "Position toolbar at the top of the screen".

If you want to offset the toolbar vertically, you can adjust the "Vertical Offset" setting. This setting allows you to
move the toolbar up or down from the edge of the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> Widgets with popups will position their popups relative to the toolbar's position. If you move the toolbar to the top
> the popups will appear below the toolbar, and if you move the toolbar to the bottom, the popups will appear above the
> toolbar. Make sure to use the "Place the toolbar at the top of the screen" setting to adjust the toolbar's position
> rather than the vertical offset setting.

| ![](images/docs/toolbar-diag-stretch-1.png) | By default, the toolbar stretches to the edges of the screen on the horizontal axis. This behavior is set when the "`Stretch the toolbar to the screen edges`" option is enabled.                                                                              |
| ![](images/docs/toolbar-diag-stretch-2.png) | If you disable the stretch to screen edges option, the toolbar will instead grow horizontally from the center of your screen, based on the widgets you've added to it.                                                                                         |
| ![](images/docs/toolbar-diag-h-offset.png)  | If you have the stretch option enabled, you can use the left and right margin values to offset the bar relative to the edges of your screen. These options are named "Toolbar left margin" and "Toolbar right margin" respectively.                            |
| ![](images/docs/toolbar-diag-v-offset.png)  | Regardless of having the stretch option enabled, you can choose to offset the toolbar on the vertical axis by modifying the "Toolbar vertical offset" value. This may be useful if you have other UI elements permanently on the top or bottom of your screen. |

## Visibility settings

The main toolbar has two types of visibility settings: "Auto hide" and "Conditional Visibility". Let's dive into the
"Auto hide" options first. These options will automatically hide the toolbar when your mouse cursor isn't near it under
certain conditions. These options can be found under "General Settings" &raquo; "Toolbar Settings".

The first option stating "_Automatically hide the toolbar_" will always hide the toolbar when your mouse cursor isn't
near it, while the remaining options only hide the toolbar under the specified conditions.

These "auto hide" options will only work for as long as the toolbar is "shown" according to the
"Toolbar Visibility Settings" that you can find under the "General Settings" tab. The latter disables the toolbar
entirely, thus rendering the "auto hide" options ineffective.

The "Toolbar Visibility Settings" allow you to completely hide the toolbar based on certain conditions. You can choose
to hide the toolbar when you're in combat, when you're in a duty, or when you're in a cutscene, among other options. Do
note that the "Auto hide" options will not work if the toolbar is hidden according to these settings. Widgets that rely
on the toolbar being visible will not work either if the toolbar is hidden according to these settings.

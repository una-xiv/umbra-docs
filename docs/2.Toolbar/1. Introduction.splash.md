| Learn how to use and customize the toolbar and its widgets to make it personal to your needs.

# Toolbar Guide

The toolbar is the central feature of Umbra. It consists of a series of widgets that can be used to display information
or provide quick access to various features of the game. The toolbar is fully customizable, allowing you to create your
own profiles consisting of any arrangement of widgets and customize them to your liking.

Umbra comes with a variety of widget _types_ that you can add to your toolbar. Each widget type has its own set of
customization options that allow you to adjust its appearance and behavior.

The main toolbar is divided into three sections: the left side, the center, and the right side. Each section can contain
multiple widgets, which can be added, removed, and reordered to create your own custom toolbar layout.

## Adding Widgets

To add a widget to your toolbar, open the settings window by typing `/umbra` in the chat window. The first tab you will
see is the "Toolbar Widgets" tab. Here you can add, remove, and reorder the widgets on your main toolbar. To add a
widget to the toolbar, click the "Add Widget" button at the bottom of the window.

A list of available widget types will appear. Click on a widget type to add it to the toolbar.

> [!TIP]
> You can add multiple instances of the same widget type to the toolbar. Widget settings are tied to each individual
> instance of the widget that you add to the toolbar. This allows you to create multiple instances of the same widget
> with different settings.

## Moving Widgets

To move a widget to a different position on the toolbar, **click the widget's name** in the list to reveal a set of buttons
that allow you to move, configure, clone or delete the widget.

| Button                                              | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1. <i class="btn fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Move up       | Moves the widget up one position in the list. |
| 2. <i class="btn fa fa-arrow-down"></i> Move down   | Moves the widget down one position in the list. |
| 3. <i class="btn fa fa-arrow-left"></i> Move left   | Moves the widget to the left side of the toolbar. |
| 4. <i class="btn fa fa-arrow-right"></i> Move right | Moves the widget to the right side of the toolbar. |

> [!NOTE]
> The buttons will show up in a _disabled_ state if the widget is already at the top or bottom of the
row or already in the leftmost, or rightmost column.

## Deleting Widgets

To delete a widget from the toolbar, **click the widget's name** in the list to reveal a set of buttons that includes
the delete button <i class="btn fa fa-trash"></i>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Removing a widget from the toolbar will _permanently delete_ the widget and all its settings. This
> operation cannot be undone. Press and hold the SHIFT key and click the delete button to confirm the deletion.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to keep the widget settings but remove the widget from the toolbar, you can open the widget's settings
> window and click the "Copy" button in the lower left corner of the window. This will copy the widget settings to
> your clipboard, allowing you to paste them back into the widget settings window later.

## Cloning a Widget

To clone a widget, **click the widget's name** in the list to reveal a set of buttons that includes the clone button
<i class="btn fa fa-copy"></i>. Clicking the clone button will create a new instance of the widget with the same
settings as the original widget.

## Configuring a Widget

To customize a widget, click the configure button <i class="btn fa fa-cog"></i> to open a new window containing all
available settings for that specific widget instance.

| Learn how to set up and use Umbra's World Markers feature to mark points of interest on the game world.

# World Markers

Umbra's secondary feature is the ability to render _world markers_ on the game world. These markers can be used to mark
points of interest, such as gathering nodes, treasure chests, or quest objectives. World markers have customization
options and can be enabled or disabled individually.

The World Marker system consists of two parts: The world markers themselves, and direction indicators which are referred
to as the "Compass". The compass is an imaginary / invisible circle around the center of the screen that contains
direction indicators to world markers that are currently out of view.

## World Marker Settings

The general configuration for all world markers can be found in the "Marker Settings" tab of Umbra's Settings window.

### Aggregate Distance

The aggregate distance is the distance at which world markers will be aggregated into a single marker. This is useful
when there are multiple markers in close proximity to each other. The aggregate distance is measured in yalms. It is
recommended to leave this at the default value of 1 yalm.

### Max text width

The maximum width of the label of a world marker. If the label is longer than this value, it will be truncated and an
ellipsis will be added. Labels are always centered horizontally, meaning that they might not take up the full width.

> [!WARNING]
> World Markers are hidden if they are obstructed by native game UI windows. Having a large max text width can cause
> world markers to be hidden sooner than expected.

## Compass Settings

The compass settings determine how directional indicators of world markers that are currently out of view are displayed
on the screen.

### Compass Radius

The radius of the compass in pixels. The compass is an imaginary circle around the center of the screen that contains
direction indicators to world markers that are currently out of view. A smaller radius will render direction indicators
closer to the center of the screen, while a larger radius will render them closer to the edges of the screen.

### Compass Icon Scale Factor

The scale factor of the compass icons. This value is a percentage of the original icon size. Increasing this value will
make the icons larger, while decreasing it will make them smaller.

### Compass Icon Opacity

The opacity of the compass icons. This is a percentage where a value of 100 means the icons are fully opaque, and a
value of 0 means they are fully transparent.

### Safe Zone Offset

Direction indicators are only shown for world markers that are outside the bounds of your screen. However, sometimes
you wish to see these indicators even if a world marker is inside your screen but close to the edge. The safe zone
offsets allow you to define a margin around the screen where direction indicators will be shown. This is particularly
useful for ultra-wide monitors where you're not always paying attention to the edges of the screen.
